TLDR; Found a simple logic bug when paying my annual Google Fiber bill (Webpass). 

I initially added a $50 payment to my Google Fiber (WebPass) annual subscription, and then switched from annual to monthly billing, and saw that $550 (the annual amount) was credited to the account, and $60 was billed to the account for the new subscription. 

{% highlight js %}
POST /api/plan_changes HTTP/1.1
Host: webpass.net
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=UTF-8

from_subscription_id=12345&cashier=
{% endhighlight %}

I then replayed the same API operation that was initially called to change the subscription about six more times and saw that each time I called it $550 was credited to the account, and $60 was billed to the account.

At this point there was $2,450 credited to the account, and it showed that the previously invoiced amount had been paid. It would have been fun to call that API operation 100+ more times to see what would happen ðŸ˜…, but I just reported it instead.

It was covered under the Google VRP because Webpass is a 2016 Google Fiber acquisition. A few days later someone took the credits out of my account which reset my account balance back to $0. 

Thanks to the Google VRP team. ðŸ‘‹
